1. Do not make a PR which may contain any sensitive info

      the enviroment by `BOT.env('VARIABLE')`
      
2. Make sure your PR is appropriate
    - Do not purposefully make it longer then it needs to be.
    - Make sure that if you are editing core files, or cogs, that it does not change too much of the current code.\
      This is because it can be harder to implement in the production bot.

    - These can include bug-fixes, change of language, etc...

        - Send another PR
        - Use a seperate commit in the PR and clearly label the files
